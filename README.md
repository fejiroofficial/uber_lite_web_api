# uber_lite
The African transportation sector has unique challenges to deal with such as the immense urban growth. How can city planners and transportation agencies deal with such a low level of infrastructure? Uber lite aims to solve this problem by providing good transportation system at a very affordable price. Hence connecting drivers to passengers with less hassle.

This project is still a work in progress...
